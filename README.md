Frinkbot
========

Frinkbot is a slash command that posts memes to your Slack channels from https://frinkiac.com/.

## Usage

### Post a frame

This will post a random frame from the search results, and the default caption (if there is one).

```
/frink nothing at all
```

### Custom captions

You can override the caption by adding your own text in quotation marks at the end of the command.

```
/frink nothing at all "Feels like I'm wearing nothing at all!"
```

### Force line breaks

By default captions will be automatically wrapped to ensure they fit within the image. If you would like to manually control line breaks you can use the pipe character ("|") within your caption to set where line breaks should occur.

```
/frink nothing at all "Nothing at all... | Nothing at all... | Nothing at all..."
```
